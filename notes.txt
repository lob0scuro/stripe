FLOW:

1. Log in to the dashboard.

2. Create a new Stripe Customer (name, email, maybe phone/address).

3. Attach a payment method (card info).

4. Select a subscription plan (your Stripe Product/Price).

5. Create the subscription.

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

AUTH:

If it’s only for internal use, consider NextAuth with simple email/password or OAuth for staff.

Or even simpler: a single shared login for all sales staff (not recommended, but works if speed matters).

FLOW EXAMPLE:

>> Salesperson logs in

>> Form 1 – Collect customer info → POST to /api/stripe/createCustomer

>> Form 2 – Collect card info via Stripe Elements → confirm and get Payment Method ID

>> Form 3 – Select plan → POST to /api/stripe/createSubscription with Customer ID and Payment Method ID

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

PAYMENT FLOW OPTIONS:
You have 2 secure paths to collect card details:

Stripe Checkout (easy, but redirect-based):

Simple UI, handles all PCI compliance.

Just redirect to a Stripe-hosted page.

Best for MVP.

Stripe Elements (custom, more work but seamless):

Embed a card form in your dashboard.

Use stripe.confirmCardSetup() or stripe.confirmPayment.

If your salespeople will be physically typing in card info from the customer, Elements gives a better, smoother experience without redirects.

WEBHOOKS:
You’ll eventually want Stripe to notify your server about events

- Payment success

- Subscription status change

- Card declines

Set up an API route like /api/stripe/webhook and register it in Stripe Dashboard.
